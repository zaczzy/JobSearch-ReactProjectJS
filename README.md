# Edit Note by Zach
This repo exists solely to prove code sample to potential employers. It is the final snapshot of an old project. It's the first systems project I referenced in my resume.

## Note:
The credential for Amazon S3 to work is stored in `.env`, please do not make it public or delete it!


## Backend
Inside `code/backend`, make sure a folder named `uploads` exists, it is needed to store client sent files.
